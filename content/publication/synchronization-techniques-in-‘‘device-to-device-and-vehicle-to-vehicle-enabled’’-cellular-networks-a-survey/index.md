abstract: "Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is introduced for cellular
  networks allowing User Equipments (UEs) to communicate directly in close
  physical proximity. In traditional cellular networks, time synchronization is
  performed by the network infrastructure equipment to address the challenges of
  coordinating independent clocks and tasks of UEs to communicate with each
  other. These challenges are more critical in D2D as the network has no central
  point to coordinate UEs. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) reviewing
  synchronization standards and techniques for D2D-enabled cellular networks and
  (ii) discussing different scenarios and contemporary cellular network
  generations. We review the main signals, channels, and entities used by
  D2D-enabled cellular networks for synchronization procedures in different
  scenarios. Moreover, we focus on the synchronization in Vehicle-to-Vehicle
  (V2V) and Vehicle-to …"
