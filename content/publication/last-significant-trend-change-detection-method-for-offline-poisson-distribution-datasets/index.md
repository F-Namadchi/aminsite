abstract: Trend change detection methods find trends in a dataset. Datasets
  based on Poisson distribution are important to analyze since they mimic many
  different applications such as computer networks. Our use-cases are
  simulations of computer networks. The last significant trend is the last
  predominant trend in a time-series dataset. Our method is a matrix based trend
  change detection that can analyze datasets with variable sizes. Reducing the
  time complexity and increasing the accuracy when determining the last
  significant trend are the goals of our method. We compare our method with
  RuLSIF, a basic change point detection method, to illustrate the benefits of
  our approach.
