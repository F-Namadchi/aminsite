abstract: Many Internet of Things (IoT) networks are created as an overlay over
  traditional ad-hoc networks such as Zigbee. Moreover, IoT networks can
  resemble ad-hoc networks over networks that support device-to-device (D2D)
  communication, e.g., D2D-enabled cellular networks and WiFi-Direct. In these
  ad-hoc types of IoT networks, efficient topology management is a crucial
  requirement, and in particular in massive scale deployments. Traditionally,
  clustering has been recognized as a common approach for topology management in
  ad-hoc networks, e.g., in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Topology management
  in WSNs and ad-hoc IoT networks has many design commonalities as both need to
  transfer data to the destination hop by hop. Thus, WSN clustering techniques
  can presumably be applied for topology management in ad-hoc IoT networks. This
  requires a comprehensive study on WSN clustering …
