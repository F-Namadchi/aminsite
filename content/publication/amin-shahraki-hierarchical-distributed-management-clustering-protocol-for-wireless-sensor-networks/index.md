abstract: In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of
  wireless sensor networks in various environments such as crisis areas,
  military operations, and monitoring systems. These networks do not use a fixed
  network infrastructure and therefore they are a popular choice for highly
  dynamic environments. One of the main concerns in these networks is the
  topology management issue, which the clustering method is a subfield for that.
  The main objective of clustering methods is optimizing the energy consumption.
  This paper proposes a new clustering protocol, which uses many parameters such
  as the activity history of each node, local and general state of nodes and
  their resources condition to determine the best cluster heads and members of
  each cluster that can increase the network lifetime, fair resource consumption
  and network coverage.
