abstract: Internet of Things(IoT) is still in infancy. There are concerns that
  IoT can jeopardize privacy as side-effects of providing the desired services.
  Social effects of IoT should be considered as an important part of IoT-human
  interaction. The interaction between IoT entities and people's lives makes it
  more necessary to have full transparency such that people themselves can
  evaluate how the IoT affects their lives. Trust between people and IoT
  industry is a significant issue for a more mature IoT. This paper reviews the
  different aspects of social ethics in IoT including equity, equality, and
  trustability. Effects of IoT in social human life and vital factors are
  explained. We review different factors that can increase the acceptance of
  IoT. The core of the paper is designing a guideline to interact with IoT from
  a social perspective. Finally, general policies are suggested for a roadmap
  for the future.
