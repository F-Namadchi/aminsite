abstract: Outlier detection is a subfield of data mining to determine data
  points that notably deviate from the rest of a dataset. Their deviation can
  indicate that these data points are generated by errors and should therefore
  be removed or repaired. There are many reasons for outliers in a network
  dataset such as human or instrument errors, noise or system behavior changes.
  On the other side, Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) is a way to monitor traffic
  and recognize unusual actions in a network. Analyzing data trends in NBA
  methods is a common way to interpret network situation. Outliers can deviate
  and produce erroneous trends that influence the results of the NBA methods.
  This paper presents an approach that based on a method for trend detection
  divides the data set into subsets where contextual outliers are discovered.
  The outliers can then be removed to have a clear dataset that better shows the
  network behavior when using NBA methods. Increasing the accuracy and
  reliability are the goals of our method. We compare the proposed method with
  the Hampel method on simulated IoT network data.
