abstract: Computer networks have been experienced ever-increasing growth since
  they play a critical role in different aspects of human life. Regarding the
  vulnerabilities of computer networks, they should be monitored regularly to
  detect intrusions and attacks by using high-performance Intrusion Detection
  Systems (IDSs). IDSs try to differentiate between normal and abnormal
  behaviors to recognize intrusions. Due to the complex behavior of malicious
  entities, it is crucially important to adopt machine learning methods for
  intrusion detection with a fine performance and low time complexity. Boosting
  approach is considered as a way to deal with this challenge. In this paper, we
  prepare a clear summary of the latest progress in the context of intrusion
  detection methods, present a technical background on boosting, and demonstrate
  the ability of the three well-known boosting algorithms (Real Adaboost, Gentle
  Adaboost, and …
