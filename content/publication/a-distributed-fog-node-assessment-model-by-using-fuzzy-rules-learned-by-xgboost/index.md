abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect more than 50 billion
  heterogenous devices around the world by 2020. As an Ultra Dense Network
  (UDN), which needs high resources to be established, different technologies
  are emerging to improve the efficiency of IoT. Fog is a new phenomenon that
  uses close powerful nodes to help end users achieve reduced delays, optimize
  resource consumption, and improve the quality of service. In techniques such
  as routing, clustering, caching, etc., nodes need to select pairing nodes or
  the next hop nodes which are used to help nodes transfer or process data. In
  this paper, a new mathematical fuzzy-based method is proposed to evaluate the
  suitability of a node's neighbors. Nodes broadcast their information to inform
  neighbors about their situations, and each node compares itself to its
  neighbors, broadcasting a score that shows its tendency to be a pairing node.
  The proposed …
