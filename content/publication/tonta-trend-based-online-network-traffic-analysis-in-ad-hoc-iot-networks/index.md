abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interconnected
  heterogeneous smart devices communicating without human intervention. A
  significant portion of existing IoT networks is under the umbrella of ad-hoc
  and quasi ad-hoc networks. Ad-hoc based IoT networks suffer from the lack of
  resource-rich network infrastructures that are able to perform heavyweight
  network management tasks using, e.g. machine learning-based Network Traffic
  Monitoring and Analysis (NTMA) techniques. Designing light-weight NTMA
  techniques that do not need to be (re-) trained has received much attention
  due to the time complexity of the training phase. In this study, a novel
  pattern recognition method, called Trend-based Online Network Traffic Analysis
  (TONTA), is proposed for ad-hoc IoT networks to monitor network performance.
  The proposed method uses a statistical light-weight Trend Change Detection
  (TCD) method in an â€¦
