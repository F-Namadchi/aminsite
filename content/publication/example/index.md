abstract: In this article, we present a routing protocol through
  intra-clustering. Most hierarchical protocols use direct intra-cluster
  routing, so that all the cluster member nodes forward their data to the
  cluster head node directly. Considered parameters are cluster lifetime and end
  to end delay between cluster member nodes and cluster head node. Also, rules
  related to queue theory have been used to determine end to end delay. At last,
  simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol.
