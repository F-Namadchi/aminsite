abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically include thousands of
  resource-constrained sensors to monitor their surroundings, collect data, and
  transfer it to remote servers for further processing. Although WSNs are
  considered highly flexible ad-hoc networks, network management has been a
  fundamental challenge in these types of networks given the deployment size and
  the associated quality concerns such as resource management, scalability, and
  reliability. Topology management is considered a viable technique to address
  these concerns. Clustering is the most well-known topology management method
  in WSNs, grouping nodes to manage them and/or executing various tasks in a
  distributed manner, such as resource management. Although clustering
  techniques are mainly known to improve energy consumption, there are various
  quality-driven objectives that can be realized through clustering. In this
