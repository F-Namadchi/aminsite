abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that is driving the
  connection of billions of devices around the world. Because these devices are
  often resource‐constrained and very heterogeneous, this presents unique
  challenges. To address some of these challenges, new paradigms of Edge and Fog
  are emerging to bring computational resources of the IoT networks from remote
  devices like cloud closer to the end‐devices. Mist computing is a new paradigm
  that attempts to make use of the more resource‐rich nodes that are closer than
  Edge nodes to end‐users. Since these nodes might have enough resources to host
  services, execute tasks or even run containers, the utilization of network
  resources might be improved, and delay reduced by utilizing these nodes. The
  nodes must, therefore, be assessed to determine which nodes should offer
  resources to other nodes based on their situation. In this article, a new …
