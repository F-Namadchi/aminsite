Welcome to my personal academic website :)

You can find more information about me here, please contact me if you need more information or if you want to start a collaboration in my research fields. I am also open to discuss about new research fields and  paradigms.

I received my Ph.D. from University of Oslo in 2020 in the field of Computer science focusing on *Internet of Things (IoT)* and the use of *Data Science* in IoT network management. I was also a visiting fellow at [Clouds Lab](http://www.cloudbus.org/) at the Unviersity of Melbourne (Australia) from August 2019 to February 2020 under supervision of Distinguished Professor [Rajkumar Buyya](www.buyya.com). I have been a member of IEEE and the national elite foundation of Iran since 2011. I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University College Dublin, Ireland in the field of data analytics. Now, I am a research associate in the field of Machine Learning for Networking at the Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen, Germany focusing on the use of distributed ML techniques .e.g., Federated Learning in Edge computing. I have published more than 20 scientific papers in the aforementioned fields in IEEE Trasnactions, Elsevier, Springer and Wiley journals. I am also a reviewer of various journals.
